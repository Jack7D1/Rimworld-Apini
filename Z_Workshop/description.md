[h2]FAQ:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Q: How do I do this?
[*]A: Before all else, check the learning helper! The most confusing aspects of apini are listed there! If you can't find what you're looking for still; create and issue on the github page as it should be there!

[*]Q: Why am I getting an error/incompatibility?
[*]A: First and foremost make sure that it is actually Apini causing this error. If it is apini note that before release all updates are bugtested quite extensively; so your case is likely very specific. Please make a guthub issue listing the configuration and nature or the error so this can be fixed. You're welcome to pop into our discord and chat live with a coder for help!

[*]Q: Will there be any development for Ideology, Biotech etc?
[*]A: No, as it stands Apini will only support Core Rimworld and the Royalty DLC. The reasoning behind this is that work available for Apini's development is very limited, and the ever expanding content for rimworld leads to increasing scope for a more or less constant work ability. Thus following the ethic "Do it well or don't do it at all." this is a line being drawn to limit the scope to what can be done well. In addition the Ideology and Biotech expansions do not personally interest development in this case. This mod may still work with these expansions, but they are not going to be actively supported.
