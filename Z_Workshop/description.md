[h2]FAQ:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Q: How do I do this?
[*]A: Before all else, check the learning helper! The most confusing aspects of apini are listed there! If you can't find what you're looking for still; create and issue on the github page as it should be there!

[*]Q: Why am I getting an error of the older versions of this mod?
[*]A: Older versions are 'frozen' and cannot be changed. Only the latest version of rimworld recieves mod updates. However before this freeze happens the version is extensively debugged and checked to ensure everything is in proper order. As a result many errors are usually very specific cases caused by rimworld itsself.

[*]Q: Why am I getting an error/incompatibility?
[*]A: First and foremost make sure that it is actually Apini causing this error. If it is apini note that before release all updates are bugtested quite extensively; so your case is likely very specific. Please make a guthub issue listing the configuration and nature or the error so this can be fixed. You're welcome to pop into our discord and chat live with a coder for help!
