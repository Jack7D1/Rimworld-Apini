CONTRIBUTING TO APINI
=========================

# General rules

* **All defnames must contain apini specific names** To avoid defname collissions with other mods all our defnames should begin with 'Apini', 'Azuri', 'Npini', 'Moobee'. Using Apini as a default is a good option.

* **Test your changes** Testing your changes locally is incredibly important. Make sure when launching rimworld does not throw any errors.

* **All PRs MUST be to the staging branch** This is so we can update the mod in large updates all at once which are much easier to test and balance.
* If your changes get merged onto staging they are available to those who wish to manually download and play the staging branch, however will not appear on the steam copy until a PR is made to merge starging into master.

# In addition

* Don't be afraid to ask for help! You can find community links in the README.
